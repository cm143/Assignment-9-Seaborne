The purpose of this project was to create a heatmap of pulse data, a categorical plot for pulse values by type of diet and exercise. I also needed to create six plots that would show data from the planets built in dataset.I used pd.read to read the exercise data csv file, .drop to drop the id, diet, and kind values from the dataset, .min to find the minimum values of the data, .max to find the maximum values of the data, .heatmap to create a heatmap of the data, .catplot to create a categorical plot of the data, .scatterplot to create a scatterplot of the data, .lineplot to create a lineplot of the data, .displot to create a distribution plot of the data, .rugplot to create a rug plot of the data, .violinplot to create a violin plot of the data, and .barplot to create a bar plot of the data. I did not add any limitations to the code.
